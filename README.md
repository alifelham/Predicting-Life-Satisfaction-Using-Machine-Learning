# Predicting-Life-Satisfaction-Using-Machine-Learning
Welcome to our research repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the computational analysis and visualization done as part of our research. Here, you will find the steps and code snippets used to process the data, build, and validate models, alongside visualizing the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python:** Our analyses are conducted using Python. You need to have Python installed to run the Jupyter Notebook. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** This is where all the magic happens! You can install it using pip (Python’s package installer). If you haven’t installed pip, you can get it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Libraries
To run the notebook, the following libraries are required. You can install them using pip:
